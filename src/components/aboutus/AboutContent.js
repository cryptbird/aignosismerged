This can significantly improve their developmental progress in crucial areas like communication, social skills, and behaviour.\n- Brain Plasticity: In the early years of life, the brain exhibits high plasticity, meaning it can form new connections and adapt more effectively. This period offers a prime opportunity to influence a child's brain development positively. With early detection of ASD, the brain plasticity aspect can be better leveraged to boost the cognitive performance of the child.\n- Parental Support and Education: Early diagnosis provides parents and caregivers with an understanding of their child's needs and equips them with the knowledge and resources to support their child effectively.\n\nFor early detection of ASD, it is crucial to watch out for the telltale signs and symptoms in children.",

However, an autistic child may not react or acknowledge their name being called. Lack of response is one of the most common signs of Autism in newborns.\n- Delayed Speech Development: A child not cooing or babbling by 12 months of age or not speaking single words by 16 months could be a potential sign of Autism.\n- Limited Gestures: Autistic infants may show a lack of pointing, waving, or other gestures used for communication.\n- Repetitive Behaviours: Repetitive movements, like hand-flapping, in infants can be an early indicator of Autism.',

In some cases, parents might adopt the deferred approach wherein they refuse to accept that their child might have ASD. This further complicates the situation and might aggravate the ASD symptoms in the child.\n- Normal Variability: In early childhood, there is a wide range of normal developmental variability, which can sometimes mask early signs of Autism.",

In addition to these tools, doctors should conduct routine developmental checkups during well-child visits, where they observe the child’s progress in areas such as language, social interaction, and motor skills.

For mild delays, primary care providers may suggest activities and exercises to stimulate development, such as speech and language exercises, physical therapy, and social interaction techniques. For more significant delays, referrals to specialists such as pediatricians, speech therapists, or occupational therapists may be necessary. Specialized programs like Early Intervention Services (EIS) can provide individualized support to help children reach their full potential.

Many parents may not recognize developmental delays until the child reaches school age, when the child’s struggles become more apparent. Additionally, some parents may feel overwhelmed by the diagnosis and reluctant to pursue intervention. Another challenge is the lack of access to specialized services, especially in rural or underserved areas. Primary care providers play a critical role in addressing these barriers by educating parents, offering resources, and advocating for early intervention programs.
